									<h3>QuickVote - An online fingerprint voting system</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fp.jpg" alt="" /></span>My project is an online version of a voting system with a fingerprint system means with help of this project people can vote for their parties through their mobile phones. They need to visit a website or install an application on their mobile phones and a portable fingerprint scanner. During elections leaders will update their profiles on this system and will get votes from their public. This project is much convenient specially for aged people who are unable to go by their own to the voting department. This project not only provides us with the best services but is also beneficial in the financial sector.
</p><br><br><br>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tech.jpg" alt="" /></span>Technology has changed everything that exists in the world. Each and every sector has modified and updated as compared to the past with the help of technology. But in the political sector there are very few circumstances where this sector adopts technology. For example, the voting system used in the past is still used by our government. 

        <br><br>
Therefore, by adopting new technology our voting systems need to convert into online systems. As earlier i mention by making online voting system (quick vote)<br><br>
People will get several benefits.First and foremost one is convenience, as Quickvote is an online app people can access their leaders at their home and vote them. In this pandemic period it is very hard to go outside from home, So in that case it will be also helpful.

                          <h2>Description of project idea</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p>Quickvote is an online App or website which provides an online voting system to the public with fingerprint features.People have to install the app on their mobile phone or visit the website to vote for their parties.Both leaders and public will create their accounts on that application. During elections individuals can explore their parties updates and services they are providing to the public. In other words they can track their parties activities, Not only during the election but also after election throughout they can see what their leaders selected by the public are doing. So by the whole year individuals can rank parties by watching their progress and services. Moreover they can interact with their leaders to share problems and get notified about any important information. There are a number of benefits provided by this project firstly there will be no corruption or frauds by using Quickvote as this is a live voting system no one can change the scoring of parties as a result of this public will get their good and responsible leaders when the voting system will declare the right result. Hence when the public will get a suitable and good political leader it will be not only beneficial for the public but also for the whole country. Consequently the country will develop faster. In addition to that there will be no man power used as every one will vote from locations so there is no need for arrangements regarding elections. It is also very beneficial for senior citizens who cannot stand in voting queues. Because of live  systems voting will be even more secure, private, and reliable. Additionally the connections with technology becomes stronger by using this system. Apart from this folks will also get aware regarding technology specially aged people who don’t know how to use mobile phones and computers. The Last but not least feature of this project is time saving. Due to the online system people do not need to go outside from their home by not only spending their precious time but also fuel of their vehicles.</p>

                                <br><br><br>
                                <p>Quicktime is very user friendly after logged in people can follow their leaders and parties and watch their activities and when elections come they just need to attach a portable fingerprint scanner to their mobile phone or any other device for voting. They just need to select a party they want to vote for and then quickvote will ask for fingerprint authentication and that’s all the voting process will be done.</p>
